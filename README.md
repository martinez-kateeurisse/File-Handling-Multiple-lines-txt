# File Handling - Multiple line of text contents
A Python program that contains a method that writes multiple line of text contents into a text file mylife.txt

Sample output:

      Enter line: Beautiful is better than ugly.

      Are there more lines y/n? y

      Enter line: Explicit is better than implicit.

      Are there more lines y/n? y

      Enter line: Simple is better than complex.

      Are there more lines y/n? n

## Program Instructions
   * The user will be asked to input the lines; thus, mylife.txt may be created automatically.
   * The output will be written in plain text file that will be created once the program is running.
   * The outputs will also be displayed in a new window using tkinter.

## Installation
      git bash installation:

            git clone [link]

            cd [project name]

            npm install
            
 Or, to smoothly run the program, install or download the following modules:

 * colorama (pip install colorama)
 * tkinter (pip install tk)
 
(easiest way to install is through pip)
